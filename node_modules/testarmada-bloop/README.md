Statsd metrics to help spot trends and hotspots in a test automation ecosystem.

The functionality of the reporter is adjustable via environment variables. These environment
variables are:

| Variable | Default | Description    |
|-------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| MAGELLAN_STATSD  |  | This needs to be set to non-null to enable the reporter to send results to statsd. This is important, you have to set this to something truthy for this reporter to run. |
| MAGELLAN_JOB_NAME  |  | The '.' delimited name of the build job. For example 'checkout.pr-verify'. You really need to set this as well. It's importante. Without it you'll have no way to disambiguate your project's statistics versus any other. Or it might just not work at all. |
| MAGELLANSTATS_STATSD_URL  |  | The statsd URL. This is *not optional*. You must set this value or the reporter will not be enabled. |
| MAGELLANSTATS_STATSD_PORT  | 8125 | The statsd port number. |
| MAGELLANSTATS_STATSD_PREFIX  | magellanStatsdMetrics | A prefix for all of the metrics. Because it's going to statsd it can, if you like, be '.' delimited. |
| MAGELLAN_LOG_DIRECTORY | | An optional logging directory path. |
