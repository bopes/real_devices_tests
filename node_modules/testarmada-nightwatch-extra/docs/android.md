# Nightwatch-Extra guide for android app test

## Pre-requisites

 1. install Android Studio (follow steps from [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)).
 2. setup AVD and create the emulator will be used for testing.
 3. make sure emulator in use has the latest chrome browser. if now, follow [here](https://eveningsamurai.wordpress.com/2014/05/16/mobile-web-automation-with-appium/) to install latest chrome apk 

## How to usage

### 1. Create test entry in `nightwatch.json`

#### For mweb test
In order to run test in appium locally, you can start with adding following code block into `nightwatch.json`

```javascript
"appiumandroidmweb": {
    "desiredCapabilities": {
        "browserName": "Chrome",
        "appiumVersion": "1.6.3",
        "platformName": "Android",
        "platformVersion": "7.0",
        "deviceName": "Pixel_API_24",
        "avd": "Pixel_API_24",
        "avdArgs": "-netfast -noaudio -no-boot-anim"
    },
    "selenium": {
        "start_process": false
    },
    "appium": {
        "start_process": true
    }
}
```

Notice that 
 1. `appiumVersion` has to match the appium version you installed
 2. `platformVersion` has to match the emulator version you installed
 3. `avd` has to match the AVD name you created
 4. `avdArgs` is optional

#### For native app test
You can also use the following block as template if you want to run an iOS native app test
```javascript
"appiumapp":{
    "desiredCapabilities": {
        "app": "${PATH_TO_YOUR_LOCAL_.APK_APP}",
        "appiumVersion": "1.6.4",
        "platformName": "Android",
        "platformVersion": "7.0",
        "deviceName": "Pixel_API_24"
    },
    "selenium": {
        "start_process": false
    },
    "appium": {
        "start_process": true,
        "fullReset": true
    }
}
```

Notice that
 1. `platformVersion` has to match the android SDK version you installed
 2. `deviceName` has to match the AVD you installed
 3. in `appium` entry, you can add any parameter that appium supports to launch appium server in camel case, such as `fullReset` will map to `--full-reset`.

**PLEASE NOTE**: 
 1. If `avd` is present, `appium` will launch emulator automatically. However there might be a chance that `appium` will time out before the emulator is launched which will fail your test. We recommend you to launch the emulator before your test run first.

### 2. Config test entry

The allowed configuration for `desiredCapabilities` can be found [here](https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/master/docs/en/writing-running-appium/running-tests.md).

if `appium.start_process` is configured and is true, `nightwatch-extra` will launch appium automatically at `http://${selenium_host}:${selenium_port}`. 

NOTE: appium is also a selenium server. so `selenium.start_process` and `appium.start_process` are mutually exclusive, meaning that you can only enable one at a time.

### 3. Enable appium automatic start/stop functionality

Appium automatic start/stop is enabled via `nightwatch`'s [external globals](http://nightwatchjs.org/guide#external-globals). You can follow the steps to enable them.
 
 1. create a `global.js` and put it in your `nightwatch.json` like 

 ```javascript
 {
   ...
   "globals_path": "globals.js",
   ...
 }
 ```
 2. in `global.js`, add following code. If you already have a `global.js`, simply put `startAppium` and `stopAppium` in corresponding places.
 
 ```javascript
 const startAppium = require("testarmada-nightwatch-extra/lib/appium/start");
 const stopAppium = require("testarmada-nightwatch-extra/lib/appium/stop");

 module.exports = {
   before: function (callback) {
     startAppium(this, this.test_settings, callback);
   },

   after: function (callback) {
     stopAppium(this, callback);
   }
 };
 ```

Notice that appium automatical start/stop functions are only enabled if `appium.start_process` is set to true.

## Command vocabulary

The mobile command/assertion set follows the same convention of their desktop counterparts (see [here](web.md)). But we don't recommend using nightwatch command/assertion directly in your app test because nightwatch doesn't support `accessibility id`. To use `accessibility id` as your element identifier we recommend to implement your own command/assertion in the same way as the included mobile command/assertion in `nightwatch-extra`.

### Mobile command list

  <tr>
    <th>Nightwatch-extra Command</th>
    <th>Example</th>
    <th>Description</th>

    <td>clickMobileEl("accessibility id", "mybutton")</td>
    <td>click a button with given selector</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>getMobileEl(using, selector, callback)</td>
    <td>getMobileEl('xpath', '//UIAButton[@name = "Add"]')</td>
    <td>return an element with given selector in the callback if it exists</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>setMobileElValue(using, selector, valueToSet, callback)</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>getMobileElValue(using, selector, callback)</td>
